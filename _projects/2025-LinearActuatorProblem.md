As a part of our statics and mechanics class in the fall semester of 2025 at Cornell University, we were asked to create a scenario in which a linear actuator (which we chose from a catalog) would be able to move the greated possible mass by the greatest amount of distance with only a rigid bar, a linear actuator, 3 pin supports (2 of which needed to be mounted to the ground), and a confined space of 150 cm x 50 cm.

In my design, I have placed the linear acutator with 2 pin supports connecting it to the ground all the way to the left side such that the left wall of the linear actuator is flush with the left boundary of the confined space. I then pinned the bar right above the linear actuator to allow for it to be moved. Finally, at the other end of the confined space, I added the weight, which would be moved up as the linear actuator runs. This design allowed for the longest lever arm for the linear actuator, which in turn allowed for the greatest change in hegith for the mass, while also allowing for a large mass to be used because of the linear actuator model that I chose, which produced the highest force in the catalog. The full details of the mechanism is represented in the image.
