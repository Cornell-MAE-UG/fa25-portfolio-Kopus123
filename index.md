## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Ahmed Arif, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, with a particular interest in Aerospace Engineering. Over the summer of 2025, I created a few personal projects including: A full-scale rover arm, a model rocket, and a rover-pathfinding simulation, all which taught me many valuable skills. As of October 2025, I have taken Multivaraible Calculus, Physics 1 (with an intro to thermodynamics), and Intro to Python, and am currently taking Statics and Mechanics of Solids, Thermodynamics, Differential Equations, and Physics E&M. In addition to my coursework, I have recently joined the Mars Rover Project Team at Cornell, and am currently working on a gimbal system for a camera on the claw of the rover.
